This is my last week at @Flipkart! Thursday- November 30th will be my last day
of work, after which I go on a 4-month sabbatical. I have to return all my IT
assets. Bye bye MacBook Pro :'-(

TODOs for this week:

1) Write a blog post about Outreachy selection and/or a project description.
Writing one every two weeks is one of the mandatory parts of the internship. I
did set up a blog last week using hugo at aishpant.github.io but it's empty.

2) Back up data from office laptop.

3) Set up the borrowed laptop with the linux codebase and all my dotfiles.

4) Become friends with tmux.

5) Go through the vimtutor tutorial 3 more times.
