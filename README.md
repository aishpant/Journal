# What have I been doing for Outreachy?

Trying to keep a journal of things I've been doing with Outreachy:

1. Thanks to @jaseemabid for the inspiration (who was in turn inspired by
   @recursecenter).
2. Celebrate openness? I am going to be working full-time on FOSS (for the very
   first time :D), nothing here is proprietary.
3. Accountability is great.
4. History is great!
